# Redis Cache Server Example with Golang

This project is an example of setting up a simple Go application that uses Redis for caching and includes a basic HTTP server.

## Project Structure

```
redis-test/
├── cmd
│   └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── internal
    ├── cache
    │   └── cache.go
    └── server
        └── server.go
```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- Redis server running on ports `6379` and `6380` (or modify the code to match your Redis setup)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:AbdulALmotalebHussain/Redis-Cache-Server-Example-with-golang.git
    cd redis-cache-server-example
    ```

2. Download the necessary dependencies:

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
go run cmd/main.go
```

This will start the HTTP server on `http://localhost:8080` and print the output from the cache example to the console.

You can access the server by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Project Components

### cmd/main.go

This file serves as the entry point of the application. It sets up the cache and starts the HTTP server.

### internal/cache/cache.go

This file contains the caching logic using Redis and `go-redis/cache`.

### internal/server/server.go

This file contains the HTTP server logic, including a simple handler that responds with a welcome message.
